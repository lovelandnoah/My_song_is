custom link for your own mixtape
landing with the mixtape id when someone else comes in with the mixtape link
  they have received from a facebook mixtape post.

1) make a link of the custom mixtape you want to post.
  (this link will host the mixtape id to use to pull up this mixtape and start
  playing)
  (maybe the link will look like mysong.is/mixtape/114)
  [X]LOOKS like the mixtape id is data-reactid=".1.9:$mixtape-9.0" 9.0 is the
  mix id
  In console we can find the mixtape by using=> Mixtape.find_by(id: 5)
    where we will use a variable instead of 5


  this link will take you to a custom route in the routes.rb
    where it will take the mixtape_id and show the mixtape.
      you can make a function in the controller where it will take the numbers
      after the last /
      and use that in the react show function.


2) send the link to the facebook post function and post it.
  now they want the link to go to the force login page and just shoot the
  mixtape songs to the search and play that mixtape
=======================================
==New Plan=============================
=======================================
  so when the link come in from the url, it ill pull the mixtape info and send
  it to the player on the initial login screen

    X player on the home screen to play the song
    set up a variable with the station id to play that station with that song
      on the mixtape
    this will be done by making  a call to the playlist
    the mixtape will get sent in threw a link http://localhost:3000/mixtape/1
    the id will be taken to the controller and used to search for the mixtape.
    the link will come in threw the mixtape controller with the mixtape.songs
      artists name and song to make an ajax call to the API to see if there is a
      similar response, if not it will go to the next song.

    in the binding.pry i got the songs pulling up. find out how to pass the name
      and artist to do a search for that song.
      @mixtape.songs[1].name      and     @mixtape.songs[1].artist

    Build a loop to go threw each song and send a request to the search api for
      artists

    redirect_to your_controller_action_url

(index.html.haml)
  if params[:mixtape]
    -mixtapeId = params[:mixtape]
  =react_component('The Home', {mixtapeId: mixtapeId || nil})

    in theHome
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
  }
