custom link for your own mixtape
landing with the mixtape id when someone else comes in with the mixtape link
  they have received from a facebook mixtape post.

1) make a link of the custom mixtape you want to post.
  (this link will host the mixtape id to use to pull up this mixtape and start playing)
  (maybe the link will look like mysong.is/mixtape/114)
  [X]LOOKS like the mixtape id is data-reactid=".1.9:$mixtape-9.0" 9.0 is the mix id
  In console we can find the mixtape by using=> Mixtape.find_by(id: 5)
    where we will use a variable instead of 5


  this link will take you to a custom route in the routes.rb
    where it will take the mixtape_id and show the mixtape.
      you can make a function in the controller where it will take the numbers after the last /
      and use that in the react show function.


2) send the link to the facebook post function and post it.
