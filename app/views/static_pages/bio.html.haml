          I am a very simple card. I am good at containing small bits of information.
          I am convenient because I require little markup to use effectively. I am similar to what is called a panel in other frameworks.
    .col.s4
      .card-panel.orange
        %span.white-text
          This is another very simple card. I did not copy this from any website, and I actually
          just made it up on my own. I made it just as long as the previous example - except my example
          is way better.
    .col.s4
      .card-panel.red
        %span.white-text
          This is the last card example. This is going to be the longest example out of any
          of the previous entries. This is because I wanted to have it show something that was 
          bigger than the rest. The bigger - the better.
