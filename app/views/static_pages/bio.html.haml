              I have spent the last several years working in the field of video and audio post-production.
              I have been able to see the power of internet development and how it creates a connection
              with the user. I enjoy hiking, fishing, graphic art, traveling,and reading.

                Spending the last four years commited to graduating college, I wanted to continue my education. After receiving a diploma with a focus on business marketing, I wanted to become reacquainted with computers. I have been interested in them since I was very young, and wish to use the skills I earned at DevPoint Labs in the field! I enjoy music, coding, playing sports, and learning.

                For the last 7 years I've been out West from NY constructing ski lifts in the summer months and boarding in the winter.  I have      always wanted to get back into coding, and this was a great fit.  I am looking forward to a long, fun time of coding ahead.
